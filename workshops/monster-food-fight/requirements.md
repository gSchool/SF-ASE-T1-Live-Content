# Monster Food Fight!

Your task is to run a simulation of a mass food fight between all the monsters given.

Your solution should follow these requirements:
* Each monster with a health above 0 takes turns throwing a random food item
* The target of the tossed food is chosen at random
* The target monster has health taken away equal to the throwing monster's strength
* Once all monsters above 0 health have thrown a piece of food, the round is over
* After each round all monsters with health above 0 gain health equal to their own constitution
* When there is only one or no monsters left with health above 0, the food fight is over

Keep in mind there is not just one solution to this project. Your solution might vary from others.

## Bonus Additions

Here are some extras you can try to add once you get the base code working.

* Include a 50% (roughly) chance for the target monster to retaliate with a throw directly at the throwing monster
