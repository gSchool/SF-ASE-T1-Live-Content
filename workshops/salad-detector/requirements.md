# The Salad Detector

Your task is to examine a list of ingredients and determine what salad it is.

Your solution should follow these requirements:
* your solution should output the _name_ of the salad that matches the ingredients in the mystery food
* if there is no match, the output should be "no match found"
* you are _not_ required to use functions, but it might help to organize some code in a function or two

Keep in mind there is not just one solution to this project. Your solution might vary from others.
