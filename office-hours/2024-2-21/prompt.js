// Write a function that takes a string as an argument and returns 
// a number representing the longest contiguous string of identical 
// characters.  For example, if the input string was "looong" then
// the function would return 3, since there are 3 contiguous "o" 
// characters in the input string.  A few more examples:

// input "eventhough" returns 1, because the two e's are not contiguous.
// input "jello" returns 2, since the 2 l's are next to each other.
// input "wwwhinne" returns 3.
