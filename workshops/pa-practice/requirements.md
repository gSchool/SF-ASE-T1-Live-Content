> Note: this practice is designed to be MORE DIFFICULT than the pairing assessment you will take. This practice will test all the necessary technical concepts several times over to provide the best possible preparation for the assessment.

> Note: This practice will NOT test for the softer skills the real assessment tests for. Things such as problem solving, communication, etc. are best practiced with other workshops and working with fellow students through Slack or Office Hours.
