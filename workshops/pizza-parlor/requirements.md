# Pizza Parlor Workshop

Your task is to use pizza topping data to calculate the cost of a pizza order. Make a copy of the `starter.js` to get started.

Your solution should follow these requirements:
* declare and invoke at least one function
* should be flexible enough to handle any order, not just the given one

## Bonus Additions

Here are some extras you can try to add once you get the base code working.

* calculate and add a 5% tax to the final price
* add checks so only one crust and sauce can be in an order
* print (log) out a well organized receipt, listing ingredients by type and their cost, with a footer of the total (including tax if you have the calculation)
