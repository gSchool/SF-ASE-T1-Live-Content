# Racing Simulator

Your task is to use the vehicle data provided to create a mock race where after several laps a winner is randomly determined.

Your solution should follow these requirements:
* Ignore the accident data for the base project
* You must track each vehicle's progress towards the finish line
* Each lap, all vehicles must move a random amount of distance but must also take into account their max speed
* When a vehicle moves an amount equal to or over the finish line distance, that vehicle wins
* If more than one vehicle reaches the finish line in the same lap, the vehicle that went the farthest wins
* After a race, print out a report detailing the winner and the distance each vehicle traveled

Keep in mind there is not just one solution to this project. Parts are left vague on purpose so you can fill in details however you'd like.

## Bonus Additions

Here are some extras you can try to add once you get the base code working.

* Do a report for each lap in addition to the final report 
* Use the accident data to take the cars involved in them out of the race at some point
