# The Widget Factory

Your mission today is to create a factory and builds widgets.

Your solution should follow these requirements:
* a function that accepts a top, middle, and bottom as parameters
* these parameters are expected to be numbers that represent indexes in 
* the function should output an object that includes all the parts as values to properties
* this object should also include a description string that includes all the parts

Here is an example of a widget object to build:
```javascript
{
  "top": "Indicator",
  "middle": "Data Storage Unit",
  "bottom": "Wheels",
  "description": "A widget that has an Indicator on top, with a Data Storage Unit in the middle, and Wheels on the bottom"
}
```

Keep in mind there is not just one solution to this project. Your solution might vary from others.
