// Create a variable that will store the clothes someone would wear
// Assign this variable an object literal with the following properties/keys:
//  hat, mask, shirt, pants, shoes
// The values you assign to these properties is up to you.

// Create a function that accepts a "clothes" parameter
// This parameter is expected to be a clothes object like the one defined above

// Using the object, build a string that includes all the cloths, 
// IE a natural language description of the outfit

// return this string

// Invoke the function and use the clothes object you defined as the argument
// print out the returned description
